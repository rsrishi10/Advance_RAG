## Overview
This repository demonstrates the integration of large language models (LLMs) using the LangChain framework and OpenAI's GPT-based APIs. It provides tools for building question-answering (QA) bots that can retrieve, process, and analyze textual data, such as PDF documents, using advanced AI models.

---

## Features
- **Document Chunking and Indexing**: Process PDF documents into smaller chunks and index them for retrieval.
- **Query Expansion**: Expand user queries using advanced techniques for better information retrieval.
- **Reranking**: Use a cross-encoder to rank retrieved documents based on relevance to the query.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect to OpenAI's GPT-based APIs for generating structured and meaningful answers.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly UI for uploading files and querying the indexed documents.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries
- `langchain`
- `chromadb`
- `streamlit`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `python-dotenv`
- `pydantic`
- `concurrent.futures`

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (added in `config.ini`)
- Configuration file (`config.ini`):

  ```ini
  [general]
  api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
  chunk_size = 500
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   

3. Install dependencies:
  

4. Add your OpenAI API key to the `config.ini` file.

5. Run the application:
   
## Usage

### 1. Upload a PDF
- Navigate to the Streamlit app and enter a collection name.
- Upload a PDF document to process.
- The document is automatically chunked and indexed.

### 2. Ask Questions
- Enter a question related to the uploaded document.
- The app retrieves relevant chunks, processes them through the LLM, and provides an answer.

### Example
#### Question:
"What is the CEO's name and his earnings? Are they aligned with market standards?"

#### Answer:
"The CEO's name is John Doe. His earnings are $1.2 million annually, which are aligned with market standards based on recent industry data."
